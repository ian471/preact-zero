# 0️⃣ preact-zero

This is a template you can use to develop a web app using
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) that runs entirely in the browser out of the
box, with no build tools required.

This means you can test without a special dev server, and deploy your code as a
static site directly to GitHub pages or any other plain old file host.

```
npm install
npx serve
```
